= vidibus-routing_error

This gem is part of the open source SOA framework Vidibus: http://www.vidibus.org

Catches ActionController::RoutingError, because this does not work with Rails 3 anymore.
It basically catches the exception on rack-level and re-raises it on application-level.


== Installation

Add the dependency to the Gemfile of your application:

  gem "vidibus-inheritance"

Then call bundle install on your console.


== Usage

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from ActionController::RoutingError, :with => :rescue_404

  def rescue_404
    # do something
    # IMPORTANT:
    # If you modify this method, you have to restart the server.
  end
end
